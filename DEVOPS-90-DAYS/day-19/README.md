# Day 19 — Python: JSON, YAML & REST API Automation

[← Day 18](../day-18/README.md) | [Roadmap](../90-DAY-ROADMAP.md) | [Tracker](../LEARNING-TRACKER.md) | [Day 20 →](../day-20/README.md)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Phase** | Phase 1 - Foundations |
| **Week** | Week 3 — Bash & Python Automation |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Estimated time** | 3.5 hours |

> **Rule for today:** do not just read. Type every command yourself, break things on purpose, fix them, and write down what you learned.

---

## 1. Daily Objectives

By the end of today you must be able to:

- [ ] Parse and generate JSON/YAML
- [ ] Call REST APIs with auth, pagination, retries and timeouts
- [ ] Build a GitHub API automation script

## 2. Prerequisites

- Day 18; a GitHub fine-grained token with read-only repo scope.
- Your lab from [LAB-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md](../LAB-ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md) is running.
- Previous day's work is committed to GitHub.

## 3. Learning Topics

### 3.1 Data formats

JSON is the API lingua franca; YAML is the config language of DevOps. Use `yaml.safe_load` (never `load`) and `json.dumps(indent=2)`.

### 3.2 API consumption

Use `requests.Session`, always set `timeout`, check `raise_for_status()`, handle 429/5xx with exponential backoff, follow pagination links.

### 3.3 Authentication

Bearer tokens from environment variables; least-privilege fine-grained tokens.

## 4. Practical Labs

Work through these in order. Record the commands you ran and the output in `lab-notes.md` inside this folder.

1. [ ] Write `repos.py` listing your repos, stars, last push using GitHub REST API.
2. [ ] Add pagination and a `--json` output option.
3. [ ] Load a YAML file of 'required repo settings' and compare against actual settings.
4. [ ] Add retry/backoff and timeouts.
5. [ ] Write 3 tests using mocked responses (`responses` or `unittest.mock`).

## 5. Real-World Scenario

> Security asks for a report of all repos without branch protection or SECURITY.md. Automate the audit and output CSV.

**Your task:** solve it in your lab, document the steps, the commands, what you verified, and what could go wrong in production.

## 6. Commands & Scripts

Type these yourself and adapt names/paths to your lab. Lines starting with `#` (or `//`) explain the step that follows. Review every command before running it; replace placeholders such as `<PID>`, `$VPC`, `USER`.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...   # never commit
python - <<'EOP'
import os, requests
s = requests.Session(); s.headers.update({"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']}", "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json"})
r = s.get("https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100", timeout=10); r.raise_for_status()
for repo in r.json(): print(repo["full_name"], repo["pushed_at"])
EOP
curl -s https://api.github.com/rate_limit | jq .rate
yq '.services[].name' compose.yml
```

## 7. Extended Hands-On Practice & Reference Notes

Extra exercises, worked solutions, cheat sheets and runbooks for today's topic. Work through them after the core labs in Section 4 and the commands in Section 6.

### 7.1 Day 19 – Shell Scripting Project: Log Rotation, Backup & Crontab — Challenge Brief

#### Task
Apply everything from Days 16–18 in real-world mini projects.

You will:
- Write a **log rotation** script
- Write a **server backup** script
- Schedule them with **crontab**

---

#### Expected Output
- A markdown file: `day-19-project.md`
- All scripts you write during the tasks

---

#### Challenge Tasks

##### Task 1: Log Rotation Script
Create `log_rotate.sh` that:
1. Takes a log directory as an argument (e.g., `/var/log/myapp`)
2. Compresses `.log` files older than 7 days using `gzip`
3. Deletes `.gz` files older than 30 days
4. Prints how many files were compressed and deleted
5. Exits with an error if the directory doesn't exist

---

##### Task 2: Server Backup Script
Create `backup.sh` that:
1. Takes a source directory and backup destination as arguments
2. Creates a timestamped `.tar.gz` archive (e.g., `backup-2026-02-08.tar.gz`)
3. Verifies the archive was created successfully
4. Prints archive name and size
5. Deletes backups older than 14 days from the destination
6. Handles errors — exit if source doesn't exist

---

##### Task 3: Crontab
1. Read: `crontab -l` — what's currently scheduled?
2. Understand cron syntax:
   ```
   * * * * *  command
   │ │ │ │ │
   │ │ │ │ └── Day of week (0-7)
   │ │ │ └──── Month (1-12)
   │ │ └────── Day of month (1-31)
   │ └──────── Hour (0-23)
   └────────── Minute (0-59)
   ```
3. Write cron entries (in your markdown, don't apply if unsure) for:
   - Run `log_rotate.sh` every day at 2 AM
   - Run `backup.sh` every Sunday at 3 AM
   - Run a health check script every 5 minutes

---

##### Task 4: Combine — Scheduled Maintenance Script
Create `maintenance.sh` that:
1. Calls your log rotation function
2. Calls your backup function
3. Logs all output to `/var/log/maintenance.log` with timestamps
4. Write the cron entry to run it daily at 1 AM

---

#### Hints
- Compress old files: `find /path -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec gzip {} \;`
- Timestamp: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
- Tar: `tar -czf backup.tar.gz /source/dir`
- Cron edit: `crontab -e`
- Log with timestamp: `echo "$(date): message" >> logfile`

---

#### Documentation

Create `day-19-project.md` with:
- Each script's code
- Sample outputs
- Cron entries you wrote
- What you learned (3 key points)

---

#### Submission
1. Add your scripts and `day-19-project.md` to `2026/day-19/`
2. Commit and push to your fork

## 8. Assignments (independent work)

Complete without copying from the lesson. Look things up in official documentation when needed.

| # | Assignment | Expected outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add a YAML->JSON converter CLI. | You can demonstrate, without notes: *parse and generate JSON/YAML* — with evidence committed to `day-19/`. |
| 2 | Write a retry decorator. | You can demonstrate, without notes: *call REST APIs with auth, pagination, retries and timeouts* — with evidence committed to `day-19/`. |
| 3 | Document API rate limits and how you handle them. | You can demonstrate, without notes: *build a GitHub API automation script* — with evidence committed to `day-19/`. |

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause and fix |
|---|---|
| 401/403 from API | Token missing scope/expired; check header format. |
| Script hangs | Missing timeout; always set `timeout=(connect, read)`. |

**Troubleshooting challenge:** deliberately break one thing from today's lab, then diagnose and fix it using only logs, status commands and documentation. Write the symptom -> cause -> fix in `lab-notes.md`.

## 10. Security, Reliability & Cost Considerations

- **Security:** Store tokens in env/secret manager, use read-only tokens, rotate regularly, never log Authorization headers.
- **Reliability:** What fails first here? How would you detect it and recover?
- **Cost:** Which resources from today keep costing money or time if left running? Clean them up and note it.

## 11. Daily Completion Checklist

- [ ] Read and understand the learning material.
- [ ] Complete all practical exercises.
- [ ] Execute commands independently.
- [ ] Complete the real-world scenario.
- [ ] Troubleshoot at least one issue.
- [ ] Complete the daily assignment.
- [ ] Answer the interview questions.
- [ ] Document important findings.
- [ ] Push work to GitHub.
- [ ] Complete the self-assessment.

## 12. Daily Deliverables

- [ ] Practical lab completed.
- [ ] Screenshots or terminal evidence saved (`evidence/`).
- [ ] Documentation written (`lab-notes.md`).
- [ ] GitHub repository updated.
- [ ] Day-specific: scenario write-up and assignment outputs committed.

## 13. Interview Preparation

Answer each question aloud in 60–90 seconds, then write a 3-line answer in `interview.md`.

1. json vs yaml?
2. Why `safe_load`?
3. How to handle rate limits?
4. How would you paginate?
5. **Scenario:** Security asks for a report of all repos without branch protection or SECURITY. Explain how you would approach it, what you would check first, and how you would prevent recurrence.

## 14. Self-Assessment

Rate yourself **0** (cannot do) · **1** (with help) · **2** (alone, slowly) · **3** (alone, confidently, can teach it).

| Check | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Can I call an API with auth? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Can I handle errors and retries? | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
